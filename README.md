# tic-tac-toe
Python Experiments No1


# 27-01-2024 02h53
This was my first experiment with python and or pygame.

It was quite fun

Took a couple hours to setup Python, read up on it and a couple more to experiment with some of the syntax

Then looked at pygame docs and some guides for a couple more hours

Tried to make tic tac toe just because I found this guide online: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tic-tac-toe-gui-in-python-using-pygame/

Looked at it for like 5 minutes, kinda found the way this person wrote code boring so I closed it and wrote it myself

Was a bit of a challenge but tried to do it using only the PyGame Docs and looking up general Python Documentation

Probably spent around 3 to 4 hours on the first master commit, 8 to 10 including initial studying time

Gonna keep adjusting it just to practice some Python and Pygame and figure out
